# Deni-wk19-BudgetTrackerPro

## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with adding functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user should be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

1. Enter deposits offline
2. Enter expenses offline


When brought back online:

1. Offline entries should be added to tracker.


Starter code was provided and in order to cache dynamic content, i.e. users' inputs for withdrawals or deposits, I incorporated `indexedDB`
